this folder include the essential programs to reproduce my work on time-varying metasurface: https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031077

the main program for experiment is 
'Generic_Optimization_2channel_wg.m'
'Generic_Optimization_8channel_trans.m'

the main program for simulation is

'Genetic_optimization_simulation_ESRR_SRR2_varactor_wg.m'
'Genetic_optimization_simulation_ESRR_SRR2_varactor_periodic.m'
